Package whisper implements the Whisper PoC-1.

(https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Whisper-PoC-1-Protocol-Spec)

Whisper combines aspects of both DHTs and datagram messaging systems (e.g. UDP).
As such it may be likened and compared to both, not dissimilar to the
matter/energy duality (apologies to physicists for the blatant abuse of a
fundamental and beautiful natural principle).

Whisper is a pure identity-based messaging system. Whisper provides a low-level
(non-application-specific) but easily-accessible API without being based upon
or prejudiced by the low-level hardware attributes and characteristics,
particularly the notion of singular endpoints.
